## 🧱 Tech Stack & Libraries

### 📱 App Framework

- **React Native with Expo** (for easier setup, OTA updates)
    
- OR Bare React Native (if you need custom native modules)
    

### 🔙 Backend

- **Firebase** (auth, firestore, cloud functions, analytics)
    
- Alternatives: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth) or a custom Node.js backend
    

### 📊 Charts

- `react-native-svg-charts`
    
- `victory-native`
    
- For Web (React): `recharts` or `chart.js`
    

### 🧾 Nutrition API

- Nutritionix (easy food search + macros)
    
- Edamam (meal planning, more features)
    
- USDA FDC (government database)
    

### 👤 Auth & Sync

- `@react-native-firebase/auth`
    
- `@react-native-firebase/firestore`
    
- `@react-native-firebase/storage`
    

### 📷 Image Uploads

- `expo-image-picker` or `react-native-image-picker`
    
- Firebase Storage upload from mobile
    

### 🧮 Forms + State

- `react-hook-form`
    
- `yup` for validation
    
- `zustand` or `redux-toolkit` for state management (lightweight vs full)
    

### 🧭 Navigation

## 🧠 Development Tips

- **Start with Expo** unless you know you'll need native modules not supported by it.
    
- Focus on **data models first**: define how a workout is stored (exercise, sets, reps, date).
    
- Build out **modular components**: one for logging a set, one for a chart, one for macros.
    
- Use **Firebase Firestore rules** to secure data properly per user.

## 📍 Example Use Case

> John logs a workout: 3x10 squats at 135 lbs → app saves it to Firestore. Next time, app suggests increasing to 140 lbs based on past data. John can tap “View Progress” to see a chart of his squat volume over 3 months. He also logs 2,000 calories for the day and tracks 150g protein. His dashboard shows calories/macros, workout streak, and bodyweight graph.
