Currently I havent goten too far in the novel but so far it is pretty interesting and very different from usual books. We are left in one location for the story. A bed room of a woman handcuffed to the bed after her husband had a heart attack when they were having sex. She didnt want to be handcuffed but went along with it to appease him. We are for the most part seeing her inner mind at work and her fight with herself as she struggles to get free of the handcuffs. She fears dying from dehydration if she is unable to free herself. Although it is in one location, the horror is still present. I am unsure if there are actual monsters in this story yet, currently only her alter egos and inner voices.
