### I - The Grudge

This section establishes a fantastical conflict in the Etheria and a grounded drama in the village of Wilthail, weaving together metaphysical and human elements.

- **ONE**: In the Etheria, a boy (Beomus) seeks refuge with a crone, hiding from Djall, a powerful arbiter. Beomus confesses to romancing Djall’s wife, Zorya, and planning to elope to the Corporia. Djall arrives, and the crone helps Beomus escape by distracting Djall with Etheric magic.
- **TWO**: In Wilthail, Derrick Thomas dies suddenly. His death affects the village, particularly young Eric Crane, who attends a pub gathering with his father and others. Eric, a budding time-travel enthusiast, had earlier stolen a laser from a scrapyard, losing it during a frantic return home after witnessing Thomas’s body being taken away.
- **THREE**: At the Applebys’ Funeral Parlour, brothers Robyn and Scott prepare Derrick’s body. Robyn feeds nail clippings to his snake, hinting at his odd nature. Officer Mcalister visits late at night to inspect the body, unsettling the brothers.
- **FOUR**: Beomus flees Djall through the Etheria, using Etheric powers to evade capture. Djall corners him at the world-schism bridge to the Corporia. Zorya intervenes, urging peace, but Beomus pulls all three—himself, Zorya, and Djall—into the Corporia, defying the crone’s warnings.
- **FIVE**: John Whistle, a reclusive Wilthail resident, is interrupted by Officer Mcalister, who reveals John’s daughter Zoe has returned from Egypt after a suicide attempt. Zoe arrives, and despite John’s reluctance, she enters his home, stirring old tensions.
- **SIX**: Jamie Carnegie, in an affair with Suzie Lees, rejects her suggestion to run away together. Their relationship sours, reflecting Jamie’s inability to sustain interest in attainable partners and his lingering resentment toward an ex, Jenny Dunne.
- **SEVEN**: Zoe settles into John’s spare room, observing his figurine-carving hobby. The narrative hints at their strained past, with Zoe’s mental health struggles subtly introduced.

_(Note: The text provided ends at Chapter Seven mid-sentence. Chapters EIGHT through TWENTY-EIGHT are not included in the excerpt but would continue "The Grudge" section, likely deepening the Etheria-Wilthail connection and character arcs.)_

### II - Ten to the Power of Ninety-One

This section appears to explore metaphysical and identity themes, with incarnations and mindstates central to the plot. Only the end of this section (Chapter FIFTY-EIGHT) is partially available.

- _(Chapters TWENTY-NINE through FIFTY-SEVEN missing)_: Based on the title and later context, this section likely delves into Beomus’s multiple incarnations (hinted at as 10^91 mindstates), his journey through time and space, and interactions with other characters like John Whistle and Matilda.
- **FIFTY-EIGHT**: Augustus Rawlings, revealed as Djall, threatens John Whistle and Matilda with a sledgehammer in an auditorium, claiming John has lived all 10^91 incarnations. Officer Mcalister and Sergei (the cat) intervene with Etheric power, halting Augustus. The crone (Emelza) frees John and Matilda, urging escape as Mcalister grows unstable from Etheric overuse, risking a catastrophic explosion.

### III - The Prince of Milk

This section seems to tie the narrative together, escalating the conflict between Etheric beings and humans. Only the beginning (Chapter FIFTY-NINE) is partially available.

- **FIFTY-NINE**: (Truncated) The narrative resumes with an unclear scene, possibly continuing from the auditorium chaos. It likely involves John, Zoe, and the Etherics resolving the grudge and Mcalister’s transformation.

_(Note: Chapters SIXTY through SIXTY-FIVE are missing, but context suggests they detail the climax, possibly naming the titular "Prince of Milk" and resolving the Etheria-Corporia conflict.)_

### IV - Eulogy

This final section reflects on the story’s events, blending Eric Crane’s time-travel adventure with the resolution of Wilthail’s characters.

- **SIXTY-SIX**: Eric awakens after pushing his time machine to the universe’s end, meeting a cow with purple eyes who reveals he can’t return due to paradoxes. The cow shows him a vision of Wilthail’s past, where his parents lived on happily. Eric accepts his fate, joining the cow for lunch and a job interview with the Whistles. Meanwhile, Jamie Carnegie visits graves in present-day Wilthail, including Zoe’s, and chats with Mary Rawlings, who waits eternally for Beomus (Sergei), symbolized by an untouched cat bowl.
