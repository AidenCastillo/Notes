Data types are data values in [memory](Memory.md) with constraints of possible values for each type. Depending on what type is defined, the values can change from characters to integers, [[Floating-point]] numbers, or Booleans.  The defining of a data type is to give the [[Compiler]] context on what the programmer intended the data to be used for.

Most languages allow for programmers to create new data types that aren't originally in the languages data type list. Example of this could be three [[byte]] color codes for red, blue, and green.

In some languages such as [[Python]], data types are arbitrary or not required by the programmer to be defined in the code. Instead, the python interpreter figures out what data type is meant to be for the variable and assigns it when ran. Other language such as [[Java]], require the programmer to define the variables type during creation. The defining of the variables also prevents the code from setting the variable as any other kind of data type that isn't what it was originally set as unless under certain circumstances. For instance if you set a variable to be a integer, you can not later try to set the same variable to a string of characters or a Boolean.
