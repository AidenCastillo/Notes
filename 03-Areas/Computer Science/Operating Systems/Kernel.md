The kernel is in charge of managing the operations and hardware. It does the tasks of managing the memory and [[CPU]] clock. It also controls the hardware resources  such as input/output through device drivers. The kernel code is always resident in memory, creating the bridge between hardware and software component. The Kernel is one of the first programs loaded after the bootloader.
