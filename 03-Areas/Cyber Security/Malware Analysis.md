The process of understanding the behavior, origin, and impact of malicious software to mitigate its effects and improve defenses.

## Types of Malware Analysis
1. Static Analysis
	*  Examines the malware without executing it
	* Analyze file structure and metadata
	* Extract strings using tools
	* Disassemble binaries using tools like [[IDA]], [GDB](./Reverse%20Engineering/GDB) or [Ghidra](./Reverse%20Engineering/Ghidra)
	* Tools 
		* PE Studio - Analyze PE files
		* Bin walk : Examine embedded files
		* [[03-Areas/Cyber Security/Reverse Engineering/Ghidra|Ghidra]]/[[IDA]]:  Reverse Engineering.
2. Dynamic Analysis
     - Runs malware in a controlled environment to observe it's behavior
     - Techniques
         - Use a sandbox like Cuckoo to execute the malware.
         - Monitor System changes (file system, registry, processes).
         - Network traffic analysis with tools like [[Wireshark]]
    - Tools 
         - Cuckoo Sandbox : Automates analysis
         - Sysinternals Suite: Tods like Process Monitor, Autoruns
         - Wireshark: Capture network traffic
