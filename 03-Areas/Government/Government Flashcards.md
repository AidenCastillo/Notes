### Supreme Court Cases
McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)
?
Maryland tried to tax the federal Bank of the United States, arguing Congress had no power to create it. The Supreme Court ruled that under the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress had implied powers to establish a bank, and the Supremacy Clause meant states could not tax federal institutions. This case reinforced national power over state power.

Gibbons v. Ogden (1824)
?
New York gave Aaron Ogden a monopoly to operate steamboats, but Thomas Gibbons had a federal license. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal government controls interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause, reinforcing federal power over state laws that interfere with national trade.

United States v. Lopez (1995)
?
A student, Alfonso Lopez, was arrested for bringing a gun to school under a federal law (Gun-Free School Zones Act). The Supreme Court ruled that the federal government had overstepped its authority under the Commerce Clause because gun possession in schools was not economic activity. This limited federal power.

Printz v. United States (1997)
?
The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act required local law enforcement to conduct background checks for gun purchases. The Supreme Court ruled that the federal government cannot force state officials to carry out federal programs, reinforcing state sovereignty under the 10th Amendment.

South Dakota v. Dole (1987)
?
Congress passed a law withholding highway funding from states unless they raised the drinking age to 21. South Dakota sued, arguing the federal government was coercing states. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress can use federal funds as an incentive to influence state policies, as long as the conditions are not coercive.

Gonzales v. Raich (2005)
?
California legalized medical marijuana, but federal agents seized a woman’s plants under the Controlled Substances Act. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress can regulate marijuana under the Commerce Clause, even if the activity happens within a single state. This case expanded federal power.
