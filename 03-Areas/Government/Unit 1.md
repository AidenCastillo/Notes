Federalism - Seperation of govenemnt, national and individual states.
national takes care of wars, deliving mial
states take care of licenses.
Both do taxes
different kinds of federalism
dual fed - founding of nation to new deal. Power was seperated between nationla nd state. Jurisdiction between problems. Naitonla owns public lands and regulates patents which needs to be nationlal for them to offer protection for inventors. Nat covers currency. State has property laws, inheritance laws, commerical, abnking, corprate insurance, family, morality, public health, education, criminal law, alnd use water and minteral election local gov and licenses.

Dual is called layer cake federalism because seperation of powers
Constitution article 1 section 8 "To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states and wth the indian tribes." Gives gov power to regulate commerce 

After new deal Roosevelt created new deal to bring the nat gov into the picutre more. 
THe new deal brough us cooperative federalism where the national government encourages states and localityies to pursue nationally defined goals
Government does this through money. They give out grants
Categorical grants - requirements and specfiic uses for the money. The national decides and onyl give money if the states folow the regulations. Two sub types of categorical grants, formula and project. Some are given based on a formula such as given for every person classified as poor. Project, states compete against each other for the grant.
Block grants - nat gives money for almost no regulation and specifications or requitements. Prefered by states because of freedom. 
Cooperative federalism is seen as marble cake because it mixes federal and state governemtns to where it can be hard to tell the difference or seperation.

Under regulated federalism, the natilnal govenrment sets up regulations and rules that the states must follow
APA regulations, civil rights, and american disability act.
Some times gov makes states follow regulations without any grants. called unfunded mandates. OSHA regulations. 
21st century american live in cooperative fed wtih some regulations.

New federalism by nixxon and reagon means giving states more pwoer with block grants. devolution gives states power to enforce regulations. Used 10th amendment. Puts break on commerce clause.

Virgina Plan - otulined strong national governemnt with three branches: legislative, executive, and judical. Representataion based on population. Exective chosen by the people
New Jersey plan - Unicamerial legistature with equal representation for each state. Each one vote in congress regardless of poualtion. Congress choose executive counsil

Both called for seperation of powers and checks and baalances betwen three braches of govenrment.
Both called for judical branch.
