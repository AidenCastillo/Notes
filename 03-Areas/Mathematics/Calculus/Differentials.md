Used to approximate certain functional values with a surprisingly accurate degree. The differential refers to an infinitely small change in varying quantity. If x is a varialble, then a change in the value of x is denoted $\nabla x$ . The differential dx represents an infinitely small change in the variable x. It is possible to relate infinitely small changes of vairable variables to each other using derivatives. $$dy = \frac{dy}{dx}dx$$ where $dy/dx$ denotes not 'dy divided by dx' as one would read, but 'the derivative of y with respect to x'. This summarizes the idea that derivates of y with respect of x is the limit of the ratio of differences $\frac{\nabla y}{\nabla x}$ becomes infinitely small.

Differential equations are equations that relate a function wiht its derivatives, often to model real world scenario like motino, heat, ppopulation
$$y``+2y`=2y$$
Our solutions are funcitons unlike traditional equations where our solutions are the zeros to the function

## Writing Differenctials
A particel moves along a straight line. Its speed is inversely proportional to the square of the distnance $S$, it has traveled
What is the equation
Because the distance formula in this is $S$, our speed function will be the derivative of $S$, or $\frac{ds}{dt}=speed$
Since it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, we can say $\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{k}{S^2}$
with k being a proportionality constant.
