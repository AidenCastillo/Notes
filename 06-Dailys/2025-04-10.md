## 🧠 Thoughts
- Today was our tennis out of town trip. We left during third period, came home and finished packing, then came back and waited for the sophomores to finish up with their english EOC. We didn't have to wait too long for them and got on our way pretty nicely. I was in the suburban and that was actually the first time in all my highschool years I actually was there. Usually I'm on the bus and i didn't realize the suburban was so comfy and had actual AC. I was with Callie, David, Jojo, and Neyali, then Johnson. I slept for awhile, read Geralds Game, and finished my calculus homework review.
- Tomorrow was supposed to be our Unit 8 test for calc but i wont be there cuz of our trip. It was going to cover disk and washer methods. Applications of integrations so basically finding volume of shapes given the radius function. It helps us find the volume of objects that have strange or unusual shapes.
- Tomorrow was also the government test which i should probably start studing over. I hope i get some tips about it this weekend so i have an idea of what to study. We have been going over the executive and presidential branch, which should be easier than the legislative or congress branch.
