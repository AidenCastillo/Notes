PV=nRT
### Boyle's Law
* $P_{1}V_{1}=P_{2}V_{2}$

### Average Gas molecule Kinetic Energy / Velocity
* Highest temp, highest energy
* Doesn't matter the moles or pressure, if same molecule or atom
* If different elements, and same temp, lower weight element faster.

### Units of Pressure
* $1\space atm =101325\space Pa$
* $760\space torr = 1\space atm$
* $1\space mmHG = 1\space torr$
* $1\space mb = 100\space Pa$

### Ideal Gas
* Gas is more ideal when higher temp, lower temp means slower interactions between gas particles
* More ideal when less pressure, higher pressure means its closer to turning into a liquid.
* More ideal with higher concentrations or more moles.

### Graham's Law
* $\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}=\sqrt{ \frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}} }$, where $r$ is rate of effusion. $A$ is molar mass
* Remember that a gas is usually 2 atoms $O_2$, $Cl_2$, $Ne_2$, but if they say diatomic
### Partial Pressure
* Count up the gas molecules and find percentage (#/total)
* Multiply pressure by the percentage of each molecule.
### Avogadro's Law
* equal volumes of different gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain an equal number of molecules
* $\frac{V_{1}}{n_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{n}$

### Charles Law
* $\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}$


PV=nRT
$PV=\frac{g}{mol}RT$
$PV*mol=g*RT$
$PM/RT=\rho$
