Nodal Voltage analysis
* voltage is defined between two points of references in a circuit (between nodes)
* we want to define voltage at a collection of points relative to one common point denoted as a reference. Schematic symbol used is below
* VAB -> vooltage at A relative to B
* VA -> voltage at A relative to reference
* VAB-> VA-VB

## Resistor
* limits the flow of current
* most fundamental componet within circuit. Represent teh conversion of electrical power to heat
* Eq symbol = R
* units : Ohm
* looks like squiggle 
* Current/voltage relationship : Ohm's law: V= IR
* describe resistor by its conductance (G), which is reciprocal of resistance and measureed in units of Siemens (S)


When resistors are combined in series, the equivalent resistance is the sum of each individual resistor

When in parallel, their conductance sums.
