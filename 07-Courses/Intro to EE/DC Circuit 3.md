### Kirchhofff's Voltage law (KVL)
* states that the sum of all voltages around a closed loop equals zero
* applied on any closed loop (must start and end at the same node)
* Sign of voltage must be considered accordeing to denoted polarity on schematic.
* Can be applied in any moving direction around loop
### Kirchhoff's Current Law
* states that the sum of all currents into a node within a circuit equals zero
* applied on any closed loop (must start and end at the same node)
* Must keep the following sign convention
	* currents entering a node - positive
	* currents leaving a node - negative
* $\Sigma i_{in}-\Sigma i_{out}=0$
*
