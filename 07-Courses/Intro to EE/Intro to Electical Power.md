Power describes teh rate at which energy is being produced or consumed
* $P = dW / dt$, where W is a function describing the energy produced/consumed over time
Power is a signed quantiity
* Positive component is consuming energy
* negative -> component is producing energy

Power is defined in a electrical circuit accordoing to $P=IV$
Formula assumes current passes through the component from high potential to low potential. (+ side to -) need to manually account or adjust with "-"
Unit for power is Watt
* 1 watt of power correlates to consumption of delivery of 1 joule of energy per second
For resistive componets, can define alternative definitions of pwer by substitution in Ohm's law
* $P=IV=I*(I*V) =I^2R$
* $P=IV=\frac{V}{R}*V=\frac{V^2}{R}$
* $Ohms, V=IR$

# MultiMeters
Multimeter is fundamental piece of electrical instrumentation which supports the measurement of various electrical quantities, including voltage and current
* voltage measurement -> voltmeter
* current measurement -> Ammeter
Modern multimeters are denoted with acronym DMM (digital multimeter)
wideley rance in cost, and form factor depends upon necessary utility of device. Handhled, benchhtop
Note that polarity of test leads (and ports) typically denoted by color
* red +
* black -

When using multipmeter for voltage. the meter is connected in parallel.
* To not modify the quantity of interest during measurment. a voltmeter should have infinite internal resistnace (open circuit)
* 1/infinity -> approach 0
When using multimeter for current, meter is connected in series
* to not modify quantity of interest, an ammeter should have zero internal resistance (short circuit)
