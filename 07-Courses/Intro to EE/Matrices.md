x can be viewed as m x n collection of scalars (not vector), where m is rows and n is column.
can be written as $$m=[1,2,3,4]$$
Elementss are denoted as $M_{i,j}$ wherer i is row ID and j is column

a vector is a matrix where one of the two size elements is 1 so a $1*y$(row vector) or $x*1$(column vector)
* vector notates magnitude and direction.

First num is y section is x

matrices can be miltipliec with certain restrictions regarding size

let A and B be (ixj) and (mxn) matrices. Matrix multipation is defined if j=m, and yeilds a product matrix which is a size (ixn)
* the # of columns in the frists matrix must equal the number of rorws in the second matrix
A * b
