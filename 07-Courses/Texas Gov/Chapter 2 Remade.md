## 1. Overview of Constitutions

- **Definition**: A constitution establishes fundamental rules for governance, distributing powers within and between governments.
- **Purpose**: Defines government structure, assigns powers, protects rights, and reinforces cultural expectations (e.g., limited government in Texas).
- **U.S. Constitution**: Brief, general principles; distributes powers between national and state governments; amended 27 times.
- **Texas Constitution**: Lengthy (80,000+ words), detailed; reflects anti-government sentiment; amended 507 times (2021).

### Key Differences

|Feature|U.S. Constitution|Texas Constitution|
|---|---|---|
|**Length**|Short, broad principles|Lengthy, detailed|
|**Amendments**|27 (harder process)|507 (easier, 2/3 legislature + voter approval)|
|**Focus**|National powers, flexibility|State responsibilities, limits (e.g., earmarked taxes, deficit bans)|
|**Lifespan**|Ongoing since 1789|Average state lifespan: 95 years; Texas’s 1876 still active|
|**Sovereignty**|Shared (federalism)|Emphasizes popular sovereignty in preamble, Bill of Rights|

## 2. Federalism

- **Definition**: A system dividing powers between national and state governments (e.g., U.S. and Texas); likened to “marble cake” (mixed powers) or “layer cake” (dual federalism, separate powers).
- **Advantages**: Promotes diversity, competition, and appropriate governance levels; allows citizen mobility (e.g., move to states with preferred policies).
- **Disadvantages**: Uneven policies, potential for conflict (e.g., state vs. federal law).

### Powers in Federalism

- **National Powers (Delegated)**:
    - Punish offenses against the law of nations
    - Coin and regulate money
    - Raise armies, declare war
    - Define bankruptcy
    - Build roads, postal service
    - Regulate interstate commerce
- **State Powers (Reserved)**:
    - Conduct elections (local, state, national)
    - Establish republican governments
    - Build infrastructure, provide education
    - Regulate intrastate commerce, banks, credit
    - Protect property rights, regulate land use
- **Concurrent Powers**: Taxing, establishing courts, borrowing money
- **Denied to Both**: Ex post facto laws, titles of nobility

### Key Clauses

- **Necessary and Proper Clause (U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 8)**:
    - Grants Congress power to make laws needed to execute enumerated powers; known as the “elastic clause” for flexibility.
    - **McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)**: Maryland tried to tax a national bank; Supreme Court (Justice Marshall) ruled federal law supreme (Supremacy Clause), states cannot tax federal entities; expanded national power.
- **10th Amendment**:
    - Reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to states or people; source of Texas sovereignty claims.
- **Interstate Commerce Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8)**:
    - Federal power to regulate commerce across state lines.
    - Historically narrow (pre-New Deal); states could ban Texas cattle for health reasons (e.g., tick fever) if not for economic protectionism.
- **Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses (14th Amendment)**:
    - Post-Civil War; applies Bill of Rights to states; ensures equal treatment and fair procedures.
    - Impacts: Bans school prayer, requires Miranda warnings, right to counsel, equal legislative district apportionment.
    - **Obergefell v. Hodges (2016)**: Extended marriage rights to same-sex couples under equal protection and personal autonomy.
- **Full Faith and Credit Clause (Art. IV)**:
    - States must respect other states’ proceedings (e.g., marriage, driver’s licenses); applies to same-sex marriage licenses post-Obergefell.
- **Privileges and Immunities Clause (Art. IV)**:
    - Non-residents receive basic rights; allows differences (e.g., out-of-state college tuition).
- **Tax and Spend Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8)**:
    - Congress can tax and spend for general welfare; funds state projects (e.g., roads, colleges) via grants.
    - Example: States adopt 21 drinking age to receive federal highway funds.
- **Supremacy Clause (Art. VI)**:
    - Federal law overrides conflicting state law; reinforces national authority (e.g., McCulloch ruling).

### Federalism Types

- **Dual Federalism (“Layer Cake”)**: Pre-Great Depression; clear national/state separation.
- **Cooperative Federalism (“Marble Cake”)**: Post-Civil War; mixed powers via grants (e.g., 24% of Texas budget from federal funds, including Recovery and Reinvestment Fund for Texas Railroad Commission).
- **New Federalism**: Devolution to states (e.g., Reagan’s block grants, Clinton’s deficit reduction).

## 3. Texas Constitution: Historical Context

- **Social Contract Theory**: Government protects inalienable individual rights; reflected in Texas’s emphasis on popular sovereignty.
- **Historical Constitutions**:
    - **1824 (Mexico, Coahuila y Tejas)**: Unicameral legislature, two Texas representatives; no Bill of Rights; Catholicism required (often ignored by Anglos). Centralization under Santa Anna sparked the 1835 Revolution (flag read “1824”).
    - **1836 (Republic of Texas)**: Modeled on U.S. and Southern states; legalized slavery; president limited to one 3-year term, no army-raising without Congress; distrust of centralized power.
    - **1845 (U.S. Statehood)**: Women’s property rights (half of marital property), homestead protections (no forced sale for debts); adopted by other states later.
    - **1869 (Reconstruction, “Carpetbagger’s”)**: Centralized power, public schools funded by poll tax/land sales; African Americans could vote, Confederates disenfranchised; abolished county courts.
    - **1876 (Current)**: Anti-government, limited legislature/governor; reflects traditionalistic-individualistic culture; drafted by landowners (Grange Party) at 1875 Restoration Convention.

## 4. Texas Constitution (1876): Structure

- **Preamble and Bill of Rights**: Emphasizes popular sovereignty; protects speech, religion, accused rights; 1982 equal rights amendment (sex, race, etc.); 2021 amendment bans state closure of in-person religious services (e.g., during COVID).
- **Article 1: Bill of Rights**: Mirrors U.S. Bill of Rights; includes equal protection.
- **Article 2: Powers of Government**: Explicit separation of powers; no branch overlap.
- **Article 3: Legislative Department**:
    - Bicameral: Senate (31 members), House (150 members).
    - Biennial 140-day sessions; $600/month compensation.
    - Details election systems, qualifications, rules.
- **Article 4: Executive Department**:
    - Plural executive: Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller, Land Commissioner, Attorney General (elected); Secretary of State (appointed).
    - Governor: 4-year term, no limits; calls special sessions (limited to specified topics).
- **Article 5: Judicial Department**:
    - Multi-tier: Supreme Court (8 justices, 1 chief), Court of Criminal Appeals (8 judges, 1 presiding).
    - Judges must be licensed in Texas; legislature can create additional courts.
- **Other Articles**:
    - **Article VI**: Voting restrictions (e.g., under 18, felons, mentally incompetent).
    - **Article VII**: Funds public schools/universities.
    - **Articles IX, XVI**: Define county creation.

## 5. Amending the Texas Constitution

- **Process**: 2/3 vote in each legislative house proposes amendments; majority voter approval required.
- **No Voter Initiative**: Unlike some states, Texas lacks petition-based amendments (Republican Party dropped push in 1996).
- **Constitutional Convention**: Legislature can call for revisions; rarely used (e.g., 1970s failure due to complexity, lack of support).
- **Frequency**: 507 amendments by 2021; state constitutions amended more due to wider responsibilities (e.g., education, local governance).
- **Issues**: Low voter turnout, confusing ballot wording, amendments often not in voters’ interest.

## 6. Criticisms of the Texas Constitution

- **Length and Clarity**: Over 80,000 words, wordy, unclear; poorly organized despite table of contents.
- **Outdated**: Includes obsolete provisions; excessive details limit flexibility.
- **Cultural Resistance**: Texans’ pride and distrust of change deter revisions.
- **Comparison**: Should be brief, embody general principles, and allow interpretation (like U.S. Constitution).

## 7. Historical Context: Texas Under Spanish/Mexican Rule

- **Spanish Rule**: Moses Austin received a permit to settle; not recognized post-Mexico’s independence (1821).
- **Mexican Federal System**: Texas, as part of Coahuila y Tejas, worked with the state to maintain contracts and attract settlers.
- **Conflict**: Santa Anna’s centralization (post-1824 Constitution) led to the Texas Revolution (1835-36).
