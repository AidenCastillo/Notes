### Short-Answer

9. **Mexico’s anti-slavery stance**: Mexico’s opposition to slavery conflicted with Anglo settlers’ pro-slavery practices, leading to disputes over property rights and economic freedom. This tension, combined with Santa Anna’s dictatorship and restrictions, sparked the Texas Revolution (1835-36), culminating in independence at San Jacinto.
10. **Gentrification/Redlining**: Gentrification in Austin, driven by tech growth, raised home prices, displacing lower-income residents. Redlining, historically used by the FHA, denied loans to minority neighborhoods, limiting homeownership in cities like Houston.
11. **Amending process and popular sovereignty**: The Texas Constitution is amended by a 2/3 vote in the legislature and majority voter approval, reflecting popular sovereignty because the people directly decide changes, ensuring government reflects their will.
12. **National vs. State powers**: National powers include declaring war (e.g., U.S. entering WWII). State powers include education (e.g., Texas funding public schools via Article VII). Both share taxing power.
13. **General law vs. Home rule**: General law cities (<5,000) use state charters, follow Dillon’s Rule, and have limited powers (e.g., Lockhart). Home rule cities (5,000+) create charters, pass ordinances, and use initiative/recall, but cannot conflict with state law (e.g., Houston).
14. **Commissioners court**: Comprises a county judge (elected at-large, chairs, votes) and 4 commissioners (single-member districts); 4-year terms. Sets tax rates, budgets, manages jails, roads, and fills vacancies (e.g., Harris County).
15. **Voting Rights Act (1965)**: Banned discriminatory practices like literacy tests and promoted single-member district elections, increasing minority representation on Texas city councils by ensuring equitable districting.
16. **Spindletop**: The 1901 oil discovery at Spindletop created companies like Texaco, boosted higher education funding, and shifted Texas to an industrial economy, reducing reliance on cotton and cattle.
