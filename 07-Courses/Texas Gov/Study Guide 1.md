- **Chapter 1**: Likely covers Texas history, political culture, population/demographics, economy, and immigration.
- **Chapter 2**: Likely focuses on the Texas Constitution, its history, structure, amendments, and comparisons to the U.S. Constitution.
- **Chapter 7**: Likely addresses federalism, including powers, clauses, types of federalism, grants, and intergovernmental relations, with ties to Texas-specific examples.

For each chapter, I've included:

Focus on connections between topics (e.g., how history shapes political culture). Review the notes for detailsâ€”I've pulled directly from them without adding external info.

## Chapter 1: Texas History, Political Culture, Demographics, Economy, and Immigration

### Key Terms and Concepts

- **Provincialism**: A narrow, rural-focused view in Texas politics, emphasizing limited government and intolerance of diversity; contributed to one-party Democratic dominance until the mid-20th century.
- **Political Culture (Elazar's Model)**:
    - **Moralistic**: Government promotes public good; participation is a duty (e.g., Northern U.S. roots).
    - **Individualistic**: Limited government for stability and personal success; politics for professionals (e.g., Texas emphasis on free markets).
    - **Traditionalistic**: Elite-run government to maintain status quo; class-based (e.g., Southern plantation roots in Texas).
    - Texas is a **hybrid of individualistic and traditionalistic**, with weak parties, low regulations, and business-friendly policies.
- **Urbanization**: Shift from 80% rural in 1900 to 85-88% urban today; driven by oil, tech, and NAFTA.
- **Economic Regions (Simplified)**:
    - Plains: Agriculture, ranching, cattle.
    - Metroplex: Finance, high-tech, aerospace.
    - East Texas: Agriculture, timber, oil.
    - Gulf Coast: Petrochemicals, manufacturing, shipping, fishing.
    - Border: Agriculture, trade.
- **Immigration**: High from Mexico (150,000 legal in 2010s); unauthorized at 11.4 million nationally (2018); draws from high-tech jobs and housing crises elsewhere.
- **Demographics**:
    - 2nd largest state in land and population; explosive growth (1,000 people/day in 2010s).
    - Non-Hispanic White: 41.2%; Hispanic: 26.5% of students (over half enrollment); African American: Growing in office; Asian: 5% (2019, up from <1% in 1980).
    - Religion: Protestants (50%, lean Republican); Catholics (23%, lean Democratic).
- **Economy**:
    - Shift from cotton/cattle to oil/tech; strong recovery post-COVID (unemployment from 12.9% in 2020 to 5% in 2021).
    - Issues: Gridlock, gentrification, high home prices; personal income below national average (2021); poverty 13.4% (vs. U.S. 11.4%).
- **One-Party State**: Democratic dominance post-Reconstruction to mid-1970s; shifted Republican due to Civil Rights Movement; now Republican stronghold (no statewide Dem win since 1994).
- **Policy-Making Environment**: Influences like money, SES, gender, ethnicity, media; process includes agenda building, access, formulation, adoption, implementation, evaluation.
- **What Makes a Texan?**: Friendly, hardworking, diverse; symbols like BBQ, Bluebell, "y'all," Texas Pledge.

### Summaries

- **Texas History Overview**: Native groups (Caddo, Wichita, etc.); governed by Spain, France, Mexico, Republic of Texas, U.S., briefly Confederacy ("Six Flags"). Key events: Alamo (1836), San Jacinto (independence), statehood (1845), Civil War/secession (1861), Reconstruction (1865-1870), oil boom (1900s), NAFTA (1990s tech growth).
- **Political Shifts**: Democrats dominated until 1970s (Yellow Dog Democrats); Republicans rose post-Civil Rights (Nixon onward); redistricting favors majorities.
- **Economy Evolution**: Cotton/cattle pre-Civil War; railroads enabled growth; oil (Spindletop 1901) transformed to industrial; tech (Texas Instruments); 2nd in patents (2020); "Texas Economic Miracle" from low taxes/services.
- **Population Growth Sources**: Natural increase, international/domestic immigration; post-Katrina influx; high-tech draws.
- **Cultural Influences**: GTT ("Gone to Texas") for debtors; diverse roots (German via Adelsverein, Tejano, African American); urban concentration in center (Houston, Dallas, etc.).

## Chapter 2: The Texas Constitution

### Key Terms and Concepts

- **Popular Sovereignty**: Power rests with the people; emphasized in preamble and Bill of Rights.
- **Social Contract Theory**: Individuals submit to government to protect inalienable rights.
- **Seven Texas Constitutions**:
    - 1824 (Mexico/Coahuila y Tejas): Unicameral, no Bill of Rights, Catholicism required (ignored).
    - 1836 (Republic): Bicameral, slavery legal, resembled U.S. but limited president.
    - 1845 (U.S. Statehood): Women property rights, homestead protections.
    - 1861 (Confederacy): Secession support.
    - 1866 (Post-Civil War): Abolished slavery but limited freedmen rights.
    - 1869 (Reconstruction/"Carpetbagger's"): Centralized power, public schools, disenfranchised Confederates.
    - 1876 (Current): Anti-government, limits on spending/debt; amended 507 times (2021).
- **Articles of 1876 Constitution**:
    - Art. 1: Bill of Rights (speech, religion, accused rights; 1982 equal rights amendment).
    - Art. 2: Separation of powers (explicit checks).
    - Art. 3: Legislature (bicameral: Senate 31, House 150; biennial 140-day sessions; $600/month pay).
    - Art. 4: Executive (plural: governor, lt. gov., etc., elected; 4-year terms, no limits).
    - Art. 5: Judiciary (multi-tier: Supreme Court, Court of Criminal Appeals).
    - Others: Voting restrictions (Art. 6); Education funding (Art. 7); Counties (Art. 9/16).
- **Amending Process**: 2/3 legislature proposes; majority voter approval; no voter initiative; conventions for revisions.
- **Criticisms**: Wordy/outdated (e.g., 500-word sentences); inflexible; excessive details; low voter turnout skews amendments.
- **Differences from U.S. Constitution**: Longer (needs detail for state responsibilities); more amendments (507 vs. 27); earmarked taxes; deficit prohibitions unless voter-approved bonds.

### Summaries

- **Historical Context**: Each constitution reacted to prior governance (e.g., 1876 anti-Davis centralization; Grange influence for low taxes/debt).
- **Structure**: Emphasizes limited government; decentralizes power (weak governor, part-time legislature); protects against debt/forced sales.
- **Amendments**: Frequent due to wide state functions; ballot wording confuses; not always in voter interests.
- **Tejano/African American Contributions**: Navarro (1845 signer); Ruby/Gaines (post-Civil War reforms).

## Chapter 7: Federalism and Intergovernmental Relations

### Key Terms and Concepts

- **Federalism**: Shared power between national and states; "marble cake" (mixed) vs. "layer cake" (separate/dual).
- **Powers**:
    - **National/Delegated**: Coin money, declare war, interstate commerce.
    - **State/Reserved**: Education, intrastate commerce, property rights.
    - **Concurrent**: Tax, courts, infrastructure.

    - **Equal Protection/Due Process (14th)**: Applies Bill of Rights to states; no school prayer; equal districts.
    - **Full Faith and Credit**: States respect others' proceedings (e.g., gay marriage post-Obergefell).
    - **Supremacy**: Federal law prevails (e.g., McCulloch v. Maryland: states can't tax fed bank).
    - **Privileges and Immunities**: Non-residents get basic rights (e.g., out-of-state tuition OK).
- **Types of Federalism**:
    - **Dual**: Separate layers (pre-Great Depression).
    - **Cooperative**: Mixed (post-Depression; grants-in-aid).
    - **New**: Devolution to states (Reagan/Clinton).
- **Grants**: Categorical (specific, strings attached); Block (general); Project/Competitive (e.g., Race to the Top).
- **Texas Examples**: 24% expenditures from federal funds; Texas v. White (can't secede); state sovereignty claims (nullify fed mandates).
- **Advantages**: Labs of democracy; diversity; competition.
- **Disadvantages**: Uneven policies; blame-shifting (e.g., Katrina failures).
- **Local Government Ties**: Counties (256, most in U.S.); Cities (general law <5,000; home rule >5,000 with charters); Special Districts (e.g., water); Annexation/ETJ for growth.

### Summaries

- **Evolution**: Dual to cooperative post-Depression; New Federalism devolves power.
- **Texas in Federalism**: Resists mandates (e.g., 10th Amendment); benefits from grants (e.g., highways); key cases (McCulloch, Texas v. White).
- **Presidential Influences**: Reagan (block grants); Obama (ACA); Trump (ACA repeal attempts); Biden (COVID mandates).
- **Local Gov**: Municipalities provide services (police, zoning); Revenue: Sales/property taxes, bonds; Forms: Strong/weak mayor, council-manager.
