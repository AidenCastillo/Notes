## Chapter 1: Introduction to Texas History and Politics

### Key Terms and Concepts

- **Public Policy**: Government responses (or lack thereof) to issues, shaped by the policy-making process (see below).
- **Policy-Making Process**:
    - **Agenda Building Identification**: Issues prioritized for discussion (politicians/people compete).
    - **Access and Representation**: Ensuring all groups are informed and represented.
    - **Policy Formulation**: Developing solutions/regulations.
    - **Policy Adoption/Legitimation**: Voters/officials decide to enact or stop policy.
    - **Policy Implementation**: Policy enforced, impacting society.
    - **Policy Evaluation**: Assessing effectiveness and unintended consequences.
- **Political Culture (Daniel Elazar)**:
    - **Moralistic**: Government improves lives; public participation is a duty (Northern U.S.).
    - **Individualistic**: Limited government for stability; personal gain drives policy (Texas trait).
    - **Traditionalistic**: Elite maintain social order; low participation (Texas trait, plantation roots).
    - Texas is a **hybrid individualistic-traditionalistic**, emphasizing limited government, low taxes, and elite influence.
- **Economic Regions (Simplified from Notes)**:
    - **Plains**: Agriculture, ranching, cattle (e.g., Lubbock).
    - **Metroplex**: Finance, high-tech, aerospace (e.g., Dallas, Fort Worth).
    - **East Texas**: Agriculture, timber, oil (e.g., Tyler).
    - **Gulf Coast**: Petrochemicals, manufacturing, shipping, fishing (e.g., Houston, Galveston).
    - **Border**: Agriculture, trade (e.g., El Paso, Laredo).
    - **Central Corridor**: Mixed economy, tech hub (e.g., Austin, San Antonio).
- **Population Trends**:
    - 80%+ rural in 1900; 85-88% urban today.
    - Non-Hispanic White: 41.2%; Hispanic: Over half of student enrollment; African American: Growing in office; Asian: 5% (2019).
    - Growth from natural increase, international (Mexico), and domestic immigration (post-Katrina, tech jobs).
- **Ethnic Groups**:
    - **African Americans**: Few pre-independence due to Mexico’s anti-slavery stance; entered as slaves; now urban (Houston, Dallas).
    - **Hispanics**: Tejano roots in Rio Grande Valley; growing political representation (e.g., Al Green).
    - **Adelsverein (Germans)**: Settled Central Texas (e.g., New Braunfels); promoted by German immigration society.
    - **Native Americans**: 28 state-recognized tribes; only 3 federally recognized (Alabama-Coushatta, Kickapoo, Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo); displaced by settlement.
- **Economic Evolution**:
    - Cotton (61% farmers in 1930), cattle (post-Civil War), oil (Spindletop 1901), now tech/service (Texas Instruments, 2nd in patents 2020).
    - **Texas Economic Miracle**: Low taxes, low services, pro-business policies; recovered fast post-2006 recession and COVID (unemployment 12.9% in 2020 to 5% in 2021).
- **Political Shifts**:
    - Democratic one-party state (post-Reconstruction to 1970s); Yellow Dog Democrats.
    - Republican dominance since 1994 due to Civil Rights Movement backlash, Nixon support, redistricting.
    - One-party systems limit legislative debate, favor majority interests.
- **USMCA (NAFTA Replacement)**: Removed trade barriers with U.S., Canada, Mexico; boosted Texas as a transport/tech hub (Austin, Dallas, Houston).
- **GTT ("Gone to Texas")**: 19th-century migration to escape debt during Panic of 1819; drew Southerners/Westerners to Mexican Texas.
- **Spanish Influence**: Introduced horses, cattle, sheep; legal system (property rights, homestead protections); Tejano settlements.
- **Mexican Enticement**: Empresario land grants (e.g., Moses Austin) attracted Anglos and enslaved African Americans.
- **Urban Issues**:
    - **Gentrification**: Rising home prices displace residents (e.g., Austin due to tech boom).
    - **Redlining**: Discriminatory loan denials in urban areas (FHA practices).
    - **Racial Covenants**: Agreements to exclude minorities from neighborhoods.

### Summary

- **History**: Native migrations, Six Flags (Spain, France, Mexico, Republic, U.S., Confederacy), independence (1836), statehood (1845), Reconstruction, oil/tech boom.
- **Cultural Identity**: Sam Houston’s “greatest country” and Steinbeck’s “state of mind” reflect pride, diversity, resilience (e.g., BBQ, Bluebell, Texas Pledge).
- **Demographics**: Explosive growth, urban shift, diverse ethnicities; challenges include congestion, environmental concerns.
- **Politics**: Shift from Democratic to Republican dominance; provincialism (rural, limited government) shapes policy.
- **Economy**: From cotton/cattle to oil (Spindletop transformed government/higher education) to tech; USMCA drives modern growth.

## Chapter 2: Federal System and State Constitution

### Key Terms and Concepts (Constitution)

- **Constitution**: Fundamental law organizing/governing a state; sets statutory provisions, limits power, assigns roles.
- **Texas Constitution (1876)**:
    - **Purpose**: Establish institutions, define authority, limit government, protect rights.
    - **Characteristics**: Anti-government, fragmented (reaction to Reconstruction); lengthy (80,000+ words); 507 amendments (2021).
    - **Retrenchment and Reform (1875 Convention)**: Slogan for limiting government power/spending; driven by Patrons of Husbandry (Grange Party).
    - **Grange Demographics**: Conservative, Anglo, male farmers/business owners; sought low taxes, decentralized government.
- **Seven Texas Constitutions**:
    - **1827 (Coahuila y Tejas)**: Unicameral, no Bill of Rights, Catholicism required (ignored), Spanish-only laws; Anglos resisted.
    - **1836 (Republic)**: Bicameral, slavery legal, resembled U.S. Constitution; limited president (3-year term); immigration-friendly.
    - **1845 (U.S. Statehood)**: Women’s property rights, homestead protections; joined as slave state.
    - **1860 (Confederacy)**: Supported secession, property rights (slavery).
    - **1866 (Post-Civil War)**: Abolished slavery, limited freedmen’s rights (no voting/office).
    - **1869 (Reconstruction)**: Centralized power, public schools, disenfranchised Confederates; “Carpetbagger’s Constitution.”
    - **1876 (Current)**: Anti-government, limited legislature/governor, segregated schools, debt restrictions.
- **Key Figures**:
    - **Juan Seguín, José Navarro**: Tejano leaders; Navarro signed 1845 Constitution, broke from Mexico.
    - **George Ruby, Matthew Gaines**: African American Reconstruction legislators; pushed education, prison reform, integrated police.
- **Articles (First 5)**:
    - **Art. 1 (Bill of Rights)**: Speech, religion, accused rights; 1982 equal rights amendment (sex, race, etc.).
    - **Art. 2 (Powers)**: Explicit separation of powers; no branch overlap.
    - **Art. 3 (Legislative)**: Bicameral (Senate: 31, House: 150); biennial 140-day sessions; $600/month pay.
    - **Art. 4 (Executive)**: Plural (governor, lt. gov., etc., elected); 4-year terms, no limits; governor calls special sessions.
    - **Art. 5 (Judicial)**: Multi-tier (Supreme Court: 9 justices; Court of Criminal Appeals: 9 judges).
- **Amending Process**: 2/3 legislature proposes, majority voter approval; no voter initiative; reflects popular sovereignty (people’s power).
- **1970s Convention Failure**: Proposed rewrite rejected; too complex, lacked public support.
- **No Reform Push**: Texans’ pride, distrust of change, and complex amendment process deter overhaul.

### Key Terms and Concepts (Federalism)

- **Federalism**: Shared power between national and state governments; contrasts with unitary (centralized) and confederal (state-dominated) systems.
- **Fundamental Systems**:
    - **Unitary**: Central government controls all (most countries).
    - **Confederal**: Independent states with weak central authority (e.g., Articles of Confederation; no Texas counties use).
    - **Federal**: Power split (U.S. model; Texas operates within).
- **Powers**:
    - **National (Delegated)**: Coin money, declare war, interstate commerce, naturalization.
    - **State (Reserved)**: Education, intrastate commerce, property rights, public safety.
    - **Shared (Concurrent)**: Tax, courts, infrastructure, borrow money.
- **10th Amendment**: Reserves powers not delegated to federal government to states or people; Texas cites for sovereignty claims.
- **Key Clauses**:
    - **Full Faith and Credit (Art. IV)**: States respect others’ proceedings (e.g., marriage licenses, post-Obergefell for same-sex couples).
    - **Privileges and Immunities (Art. IV)**: Non-residents get basic rights (e.g., out-of-state tuition allowed).
    - **Comity Clause (Art. IV)**: Informal recognition of other states’ laws/decisions.
    - **Supremacy Clause (Art. VI)**: Federal law prevails over state law.
- **Grants-in-Aid**:
    - **Categorical**: Specific purposes with strings (e.g., Medicaid, highway funds).
    - **Block**: General use, flexible (e.g., community development, education).
    - **Research**: Health, tech (e.g., Southwest Research).
    - **Project/Competitive**: Contested funds (e.g., Race to the Top, FAFSA).
    - **Discretionary**: Competitive, specific (e.g., justice programs, sport fish restoration).
- **Layer Cake Federalism**: Dual federalism; clear national/state separation (pre-Great Depression).
- **New Federalism**: Devolution to states (Reagan: block grants; Clinton: deficit reduction, DOMA; Bush: Patriot Act; Obama: ACA; Trump: ACA repeal attempts; Biden: COVID mandates).
- **Local Role**: Most citizen services (e.g., schools, police) from state/local governments; 24% Texas budget from federal funds.

### Summary

- **Constitution**: Texas’s 1876 document limits government (anti-Reconstruction); amended often due to state responsibilities; reflects Grange’s conservative, low-tax goals.
- **Federalism**: Texas navigates shared power; resists federal mandates (10th Amendment); benefits from grants; key clauses ensure state cooperation (e.g., Full Faith and Credit).
- **Key Figures**: Tejano (Navarro, Seguín) and African American (Ruby, Gaines) contributions shaped constitutions and reforms.
- **Challenges**: Lengthy, outdated constitution; low voter turnout skews amendments; federal-state tensions (e.g., Texas v. White: no secession).

## Chapter 7: Local Government

### Key Terms and Concepts

- **Local Governments**: Provide services (police, fire, water), enact regulations, levy taxes (sales, ad valorem/property primary sources).
- **City Types**:
    - **General Law**: <5,000 population; follow state charters (7 options); bound by Dillon’s Rule (must seek state approval for powers).
    - **Home Rule**: 5,000+ population; create own charters; pass ordinances not conflicting with state law; initiative, recall, referendum powers.
- **Designation**: Legislature determines city type based on population.
- **Forms of Municipal Government**:
    - **Strong Mayor-Council**: Mayor has budget/veto power, acts as CEO (e.g., Houston).
    - **Weak Mayor-Council**: Mayor equals council; limited powers (e.g., San Antonio, Mayor Jones).
    - **Council-Manager**: Council sets policy; manager handles administration (most common).
    - **Commission (Galveston Plan)**: Small board with legislative/executive powers; 5-7 members.
- **Elections**:
    - Mayors: At-large (city-wide).
    - Council: Single-member districts (increases diversity, per Voting Rights Act 1965).
    - Non-partisan: No party labels; low turnout; personal politics dominate.
- **Annexation**: Cities expand by incorporating contiguous areas (e.g., San Antonio builds roads to annex).
- **Extraterritorial Jurisdiction (ETJ)**: Regulates unincorporated areas near cities for planning/sprawl control.
- **Eminent Domain**: Government takes private land for public use with compensation.
- **Charters**: City “constitutions” defining structure/powers; critical for home rule autonomy.
- **Redistricting**: Cities redraw districts every 10 years (post-census) to balance population, ensure fair representation (Voting Rights Act compliance).
- **Revenue Bonds**: Borrowed funds for projects (e.g., infrastructure); repaid by voters via taxes.
- **County Government**:
    - **Role**: Set tax rates, budgets; manage jails, facilities, fire protection, sanitation.
    - **Commissioners Court**: Elected body (county judge, 4 commissioners); fills vacancies, oversees services.
- **Special Districts**: Focused entities (e.g., water, libraries, colleges); created by state or local vote.
- **Voting Rights Act (1965)**: Increased minority representation via single-member districts; banned discriminatory practices.

### Summary

- **Structure**: Texas has 256 counties (most in U.S.), 1,200+ cities (75% general law), 3,000 special districts; local governments handle daily services.
- **Revenue**: Sales (6.25% state + 2% local max), property taxes, bonds, fees.
- **Governance**: Home rule offers flexibility; annexation/ETJ manage growth; Voting Rights Act ensures equitable representation.
- **County Importance**: Commissioners courts oversee rural services, complement urban municipalities.
