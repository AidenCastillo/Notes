Demo party responded to third party wants by adopting progressive reform and use gov to possitively affect econ in agr or business power. Yellow Dog Demo descrirpbes somoen who only vote for demo candidates, the voting habits of many texans.
The Great Depression threw down the repub parrty because Hoover was in office. Demo supported job programs and military development.
Civil rights movment in lat 1950 pulled Demos into the Republican Party. Majority of Texas supported Nixon and it grew from there. by 2002 rupub was statewide. Anglo male votese and business supported republican candidates. Redistricting has guaranteed majorities in the state.

## Political Culture
moralistic subculutre exercise power for betterment of commonwealth. Use gov as instrument for change and promoting all peoples general welfare. Seek office not for personal gain but desire to serve public (north)
Individual subculutre doesn't concern about good society. But internvention in private sector should be kept to minimum. (mid)
Traditionalistic subculture keeps existing politicial order, particiipation to small, self perpetuating elite. Public wit limited power, policies benefit public only when elite allow it. Class based. (south)
African American enslaved people forced to adopt traditionalistc culture of their ANglo slave ownders.
Gov is typically limited int exas with power devided between many elected officals. Governor is pretty weak with most power in state legistature. Not many regulations on business. 
## Prorgessivism and Ideologies
Classical liberalism focuese on limited gov, rule of law, protecting indivudal rights and free market. 
Mercantilism is countrires wealtha nd power are synonymous and war is inevidtable. Gov hhad right and duty to reulate econ and foster development. Losts of gov control and interaction. How european monarchs tranted trade and colonieal monopolies
Texas opposed taxes and government regulation during Thomas Jefferson or Andrewe Jacksons eras. 
Social conservatism was high, meaning many opposed abortion and same sex marrriage. Robust protections of religigon, defended prayer in school, annd alternatives to evoolution tought in school.
Populists caled fro federal and state gov to help small businesses farmers or rancher with competition from large corps or foreign business. Anti immigrant. Primary rural and small town movments.
Progressive or modern liberal have relationship between people and gooverment. WIth them not scared of gov internvention believing it was a potent force for good. Large part of modern democratic party and gorwing forrce in state. 
Consittution establishes fundamental rules eby which naitons and states govern. America has US consittion distributing power within national and between states. This is called fedreal system of government. Texas has this as well. 

Us consitution distributes powers between national and state governments, granting or denying powers to those governments. Some powers are reserved for states only or national only. Some are granted to both or denied for both. Like marble cake, it can be mixed together or seperated.

Necessary and Proper Clauses, Tenth (interstate commerce clause) equal proections and due process clause from fourteeth and power to tax and spend to promote general welfare 

National Powers
* punsish offernese aiganst law of nation
* coin and regulate money
* raise army
* declare war
* define bankruptcy
* build roads nad postal service

State powers
* local state and national elections
* establish republican forms of government
* build infrastructure
* provide education
* regulate intrastate commerce
* protect property right
* regulate banks and credit
* regulate land use

## Necessary and proper clause
Necessary and proper clause states congress have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the forgoing powers and all other powers vested by consittution in the government. Grants considerable powers to national government. But tenth regulates national by reserving all other powers not listed in constitution to the states or to the people. Cause of conflict and overlap.

MCCulloch v Mayland - maryland wanted to tax a branch of national bank in baltimore. Justice marshall broaded the interpretation of clause making it "elastic clause" becaues it allowed congress to decide the means to carry out ends. State law was in conflict wiht national law "sumpreme law of the land" and federal law would prevail over state law. without this, any state could ignore federal law. States can not tax government

When texas was under spanish rule and mexico was under spanish rule. Moses Austin had permit to settle in state. Mexico gained independence and didn't regocnize his permit. When Mexico fell and became republic with federal structure, austin worked wiht state government in Coahuila Y Tejas to maintain conracts and bring in settlers. 

## interstate commerce clause
Supreme court had narrow view of interstate commerce clause and applied onlyl to goods that were transported across state lines, leaving most regulationt o states. many states prohibited cattle from texas due to fear of infections of tick fever. if prohibition of imporant item was to protect health or saftey and not a barrier to improse a restricted trade, it was allowewd. If they wanted to protect internal economy like out of state competition, it was not a valid barrier, and court was deciding it. 

## Equal protections and Due Process clauises of 14th
Bill of rights only applied to national government. Congress can't limit religion, but states could.
After civil war the 14th amendment gave African Americans rights 
"No state shall make or enfore any law which shall adridge the privilges or immunities of cirtizens of the united state; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or propery, without due process of law, or deny to any person within its jurisdictionthe equal proection of law"
Equal proections clause and due process clauses means state and local gov must treat people equally according to established rules and procedures
States may no longer require prayer in public school. Miranda warnings, right to counsel in criminal procedusres, no self incrimination. forced to approtion legislative districts equally by population

## Tax and general welfare
congress couldl tax and spend to promtoe general welfare. But lacked poewrs to provide basic service to citizien like operate schools hospitals build roads. These are reserved for states. can provide money to states.Congress gives moeny to promote certain areas like roads or college. sstates agree to 21 drinking age to recieve federal money. 

Federalism can promote diversity
Appropriate level of government in particular purpiose
and states can compete, citizins can move places.

Dual fderalism had delegatetd  pwoers for both sides of governemnt. it was a layer cake with clearly defined areas of influecnce. After cicil war, state rights and national rights mixed.

Texas Railroad Commision recieves money annually from federal recovery and reinvesetment fund. 24% of expenditure is from federal government.

Full faith and credit clauses is states must respect other state proceedings like marriage or drivers license.

2016 fourteeth amendment procted marriage as fundamental right and extended it rights to personal choices or dignity and autonomy such as intimate choices or identity.  Allowed gay marraige

States can't violate basic right or proected priviledges of individual federal citizen who isn't a resident or citizen of toehr state. Alll states must recognize or permit marriage licenses for smae sex couples regarless of residency. Privilieges and Immunity clause.
* Residents and non residents can be treated differently such as out of state tuition for college.

## Differences
should ideally be brief and explicit. embody only general principles of government and provide broad outlines of government subject to interpretation.
Good constitution serves to reinforce cultural expectations not sufficient in and of itself.
Most state contitutions are lengthy some with over 400k+(alabama)
Needs to be longer than US because nature of state responsibility
State const have limited life span lasting average 95 years.
Texas has been amended 507 times as of 2021
Const has limits on how funds are spent. Taxes are earmarked for specific purposes. few constitutions prohibit deficit expendicurres unelss approved by voters in form of a bond electrion


## Amending
2 thirds of each house must promose amendments and majority of voters who vote on the amendment must approve it.
Voter initialive is second way and it requires collection of a prescribed number of signatures on a petition within a set time. Texas does not have this. Republican party pushed idea for yeaers but in 1996 was dropped.
Texas allows legislature ot submit to the voters the question of calling a constitutional convention to propose amendments. Normally used for general revisions and not single amendments. 
State constitutionas amendned more than US. states have wider range of functions. 
Voter turnout rates often pretty low in texas or are skewed. Ballot wording can confuse voters by misleading or not meaning ful if voter hasn't studied issue before. Most amendmens are not in the voters interests or needs. 
## Constitutional criticism
unclear and wordy, outdated.
It is not wel organized even though it has a table of contence and index.
It is not flexible and constanly changing seems contraditcory. Excessive details  that broad statements would allow wider use of interpreation.
Texans would probbaly be insulted if you told them there needs ot be a revision.
City Governments are municipal corportations, granted a corportate charter by their state. 
Municipality means free city capable of governmening its local affairs, even through subordinate to the overall rule.
City charter provides basic organization and structure of city gov, outlines powers and authority of gov and officials.

General Law Cities - charter spelled out in state statutes. must choose from 7 charters provided in these statutes. 75% all Texas cities under general Law.

Home rule Cities - must have atleast 5,000 population. Gives local citizens greater range of gov structure or organization. Cities can pass ordinances not prohibited by state law, as long as it doesn't conflict with state law or violate state constitution.
