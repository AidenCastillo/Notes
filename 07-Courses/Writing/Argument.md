Argument - remove the negative connotation. Typically we associate it with negative or fighting with each other. But really it can just mean a free exchange of ideas between people both trying to solve a problem. Both a product and process. They contain claims.

Reasons are also claims but they support or highlight the main claim.

We are like lawyers, we take a stance on a position, our jury is partly our opposition and not really neutral all of the time.

Ground are evidence and examples (sources from database) used to support our reasons. It gives us the creditability like calling a witness in court (he saw the person flee).

Persuasion should be fair, reasonable, reliable, and not just bash the opposition. The facts need to be shared and believed by both, stops both sides from just denying everything each says. Say what they want to hear (sometimes comes out like a lying teenage).

Sometimes the debater doesn't entirely know their own stance on the position.

Don't do a delayed thesis statement, get it at the start in the introduction.
35% should be opposition. Have a medium between representing your own side and the other side giving credit or understanding the pros of the other side. Don't lie about the other side, greatly affects creditability.

Warrant is a unstated assumption, faulty assumption. Do not have any straw man or rotten fish or fallacies. Assumption that all terrorists look like one race.
