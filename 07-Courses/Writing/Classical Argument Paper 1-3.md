## quotation within a source
Garza argues that "     "(qtd in smith)
FOr MLA formate, if there is no page number in original source. you do not need to put any page number in the intext citation

if more than one author (30 or more) for article you say "et al" for example:
"      " (chang et al)
still need to cite summaries


You are using the Toulmin courtroom model system - like a lawyer in court trying to persuade your opposition to your side of the prompt - your main claim in your enthymeme in the first paragraph.

Enthymeme(thesis) is our foundation of entire argument. It must be in the first paragraph, and at the end of it. 

Classical Arugment - explicit arguments. a self announcing structing based upon your enthymeme (thesis)

Your main claim + the word because + your three reasons of support

* Try to put it all into one sentence or if too long, your third reason can follow the enthymeme as a seperate sentence if need be.
Your enthymeme must be in the correct, assigned formate or the entire logos/logic of your argument will fall apart (and you will fail the paper if so).

Pathos - emotional appeal. Required. Always use pathos for your side as it can be the most persuasive. Hypotheticals.
Ethos - how you address opposition, your tone(not insulting), being fair. Execellent proofreading. If paper has tooo many major mechanical errors (bad proofreading) the reader cannot reach your content and the paper can fail.
Logos - your enthymeme, reasons, 1st paragraph, foundation for all that follows, grounds for evidence.
