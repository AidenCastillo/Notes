*Prompt:* Should there be more regulation of today’s increasingly sophisticated AI (artificial intelligence) programs

*Context:* Many of the most intelligent technology scientists, engineers, doctors, ethicists, policy makers, entrepreneurs and more have spoken recently of both the promises and dangers of today’s quickly advancing generative AI programs. Even some of the gigantic, multi-billion dollar tech companies themselves such as Microsoft, Google (Alphabet), Open AI, Meta, and Apple who are currently inventing, revising, and implementing generative AI have called for there to be some regulations and, at the least, more public discussion of AI which could profoundly change our society _and your own immediate future._ Now is your chance then to argue and debate this policy that will affect, or is arguably affecting already, your current life and any future employment or career you may seek.

# Claims

# Evidence
  - AI Inbreeding: AI systems are increasing in the amount of training data. This training data is often sourced from either publicly available datasets or proprietary data owned by companies. It is also now being trained on data generated by other AI systems, leading to a phenomenon known as "AI inbreeding." This can result in a lack of diversity, creativity, and innovation from AI systems.
  - Lack of Regulation: Currently, there is a lack of common regulations governing the development or implementation of AI technologies. Leads to ethical concerns, privacy issues, or misuse of AI systems.
  - AI Misuse: Deepfakes, misinformation, cheating, phishing, and other malicious uses of AI.
  - AI Programming:
    - Improved efficiency and productivity in various tasks.
    - Automation of repetitive tasks, allowing humans to focus on more complex problems.
    - Any use of AI changes licensing agreements and intellectual property considerations.
    - Vibe Coding: The use of AI to generate code based on user descriptions.
