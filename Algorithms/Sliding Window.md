The Sliding window algorithm is a [[O(n)]] algorithm that uses a fixed window that moves around to be used for calculations. This method optimizes programs because it reduces the need for nested loops by reusing the window for later calculations.

## How it Works

By adding 1 to left and right pointers, we move the window along the array while we perform a function to the indexes between the two points.
