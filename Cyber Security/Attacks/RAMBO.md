## Air Gap
To protect sensitive data, some systems will completely disconnect from any network or internet so no data can enter or leave the system.
RAMBO is able to overcome this obstacle by creating software generated radio signals. 

## Attack
Malware, somehow installed and placed on a system (through USB, downloaded before going offline, or malicious person placing the code on the computer), is able to turn the comptuers Random Access Memory into a radio transmitter.
During the attack phase of the malware, the program will collect all sensitive data, like passwords, files, biometric data, keyloggers, and transmits the data through electromagnetic emissions.
As electrical signals are sent through the memory to store data, electromagnetic fields are created as a biproduct. To make the EM energy benefitical for hackers, they need to be able to control the trasnmitter to modulate the data as ones and zeros for a reciever to decode and read data from.
The program must create a set of rules such as the time between bianry values for the
